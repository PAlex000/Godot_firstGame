# Godot_firstGame
This is my first game in godot, was based on a tutorial:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html

How to start:
Clone the project and then open the "project.godot" file with godot exe. After it's opened, press F5 and have fun!

Hope you enjoy it.
